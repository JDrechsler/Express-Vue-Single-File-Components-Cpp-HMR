# Express-Vue-Single-File-Components-Cpp-HMR

I will add a better readme later. For now it is a working template which is using the following:

- Vue with Single File Components and TypeScript
- Socket.io for communication between server/client
- Native C++ Modules (winprocess in that case)
- Webpack 2 + Hot Module Replacement
